# DistributedDB_ProjectA

**Transactions management between multiple databases:**
created an "online store" using a MS SQL Server database, including:
* Keeping track of inventory and orders,
* managing incoming transactions from external users,
* maintaining a log of transaction,
* applying lock mechanisms on items,
* and interacting with other "online stores" through a main database.
